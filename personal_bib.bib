  abstract  = {This paper presents a four channel phased array transmitter at 15 GHz aimed for the upcoming 5G wireless systems. The circuit is designed and fabricated using 45 nm  CMOS silicon on insulator technology. The design is programmable with exhaustive digital controls available for parameters such as bias voltage, resonance frequency, and gain. The phase shift required for the phased array is provided at RF using an IQ vector modulator (IQVM) topology, which provides both amplitude and phase control. Based on the measurement results, the IQVM provides 360° of phase shift and 15 dB of gain variation. Both phase and amplitude information are encoded in a 10 bit control word. The mean angular separation provided by the IQVM is 3° at optimum amplitude levels. Active area occupied is 2.88 square millimeter. Total DC power consumed by one transmit channel from 1 and 2.6 V supply is 268 mW. The maximum RF output power from one transmit channel is 1dBm. Measured EVM for a 256 QAM modulated signal is as low as 2.0%. All results include the impact of printed circuit board traces and pad parasitics. Based on the achieved results, the proposed architecture is well suited for the next generation of the wireless systems.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents a fully integrated phased array receiver containing two four element radio frequency (RF) beamforming receivers supporting two multiple-input multiple-output channels. The receivers are designed and fabricated using 45 nm CMOS SOI technology. A 10 bit IQ vector modulator phase shifter (IQVM) is implemented in RF signal paths to control the phase and amplitude of the received signal before combining. Each IQVM provides 360° phase shift control and 17 dB gain variation. An off-chip, simultaneous high-Q impedance matching and bandpass filtering technique for each low-noise amplifiers is presented using non-uniform transmission line segments. Measured downconversion gain at 100 MHz intermediate frequency and noise figure (NF) of a single path are 23 and 5.4 dB, respectively, giving estimated 3.4 dB NF for a single element when simulated PCB and matching losses are taken into account. 1 dB compression point and Input third-order intercept point (IIP3) are − 37 and − 28 dBm, respectively. Each four-element receiver consumes 486 mW DC power from 1.2 V power supply. Total area of two receivers is 5.69 mm2.},
